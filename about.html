                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    Healthy Harbour Watchers is a community-driven initiative dedicated to monitoring, 
                    protecting, and preserving the health of our harbour waters. Founded by a group of 
                    passionate environmental advocates, we bring together scientists, volunteers, and 
                    concerned citizens to ensure our harbours remain vibrant and sustainable.
                </p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>
                    Established in 2020, our organization was born out of concern for declining water 
                    quality and marine biodiversity in local harbour areas. What started as a small 
                    group of volunteers conducting weekly water tests has grown into a comprehensive 
                    monitoring and advocacy program that engages hundreds of community members.
                </p>

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>
                    Our work encompasses several key areas:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #555; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Water Quality Monitoring:</strong> Regular testing of pH levels, dissolved oxygen, 
                        nutrient concentrations, and pollutant detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Marine Life Surveys:</strong> Tracking species diversity, population health, 
                        and habitat conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Education:</strong> Workshops, school programs, and public events 
                        to raise awareness about harbour health</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> Working with local government to implement 
                        sustainable harbour management practices</li>
                    <li><strong>Cleanup Initiatives:</strong> Organizing regular harbour cleanup events 
                        to remove debris and pollutants</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>
                    We are guided by principles of scientific rigor, community engagement, environmental 
                    stewardship, and transparency. We believe that healthy harbours are essential for 
                    thriving coastal communities and that everyone has a role to play in protecting 
                    these vital ecosystems.
                </p>
